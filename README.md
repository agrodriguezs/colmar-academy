# LEARN HOW TO BUILD CAPSTONE PROJECT WEBSITES

## Colmar Academy

I am tasked with designing and creating the landing page for a new school. I will make informed design decisions about color and typography using the skills that I have been practicing in my Codecademy course.

For this project they provided me with wireframes. A wireframe is a document that contains the positioning of elements on a page without specifying any other design information. This allows designers and developers to focus on the flow of a site without being distracted by design decisions like color and typography. These design aspects are important, but when introduced too early, they can detract from other important decisions.

For this project, I will implement the site specified by the wireframes and make the remaining design decisions to complete the site.
